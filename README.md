Similar to [the cbse repository](https://github.com/Leader-board/cbse), this one provides some analysis and results for a couple of state boards in India. 

* For Karnataka, the code is available as native git, but most of the dataset itself is on GitHub releases.
* For Kerala, the code, results and analysis are available as native git (this is due to the larger number of files _and_ the fact that none of the individual files crossed the 100MB hard limit that using native git on GitHub has)
